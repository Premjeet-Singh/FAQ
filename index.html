			<li class="a">Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is useful for bootstrapping a hardware device that does not have a disk on which to store system software. All the device needs is a network connection and a small amount of read only memory (ROM) into which TFTP, UDP and IP are hard-wired.</li>
